## Description
The experiment is exploring:
* NFTs that — as you stake them — give you more NFTs
* NFTs that are held in your wallet but more are minted / some are burned based on some threshold (e.g., oracle that 1 NFT = 0.1 ETH)

### Use Case
* Rebasing NFTs would be absurd and hilarious
* People get yield from their NFTs
